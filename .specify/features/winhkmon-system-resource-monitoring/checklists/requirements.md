# Specification Quality Checklist: Windows Hardware Monitor (WinHKMon)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes:**
- ✅ Spec focuses on WHAT and WHY throughout
- ✅ User scenarios clearly articulate value propositions
- ✅ Requirements are outcome-focused, not implementation-focused
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: Executive Summary, User Scenarios, Functional Requirements, NFRs, Success Criteria, Out of Scope, Dependencies/Assumptions, Constraints

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes:**
- ✅ All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers from original docs/spec.md have been resolved with informed decisions
- ✅ Every requirement has clear acceptance criteria
- ✅ Success criteria use measurable targets (< 1% CPU, within 5% of Task Manager, 100+ stars)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "users see results instantly" vs "API response time")
- ✅ Three comprehensive user scenarios cover primary flows
- ✅ Six edge cases and five error scenarios documented in Section VI
- ✅ Out of Scope section (Section VII) clearly defines boundaries with 11 excluded items
- ✅ Dependencies section lists 4 dependencies with mitigation strategies
- ✅ Assumptions section lists 8 explicit assumptions
- ✅ Constraints section lists 8 constraints

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes:**
- ✅ All 8 functional requirement categories (FR-1 through FR-8) have detailed acceptance criteria
- ✅ User scenarios cover three primary personas: System Admin, Developer, Power User
- ✅ Six success criteria categories defined with specific measurable targets
- ✅ Spec maintains technology-agnostic language throughout (no mention of specific Windows APIs, data structures, or implementation approaches)

---

## Summary

**Overall Status**: ✅ **PASS** - Specification is complete and ready for planning phase

**Strengths:**
1. Comprehensive user scenarios with concrete examples
2. Well-structured functional requirements with clear acceptance criteria
3. Extensive non-functional requirements covering performance, reliability, compatibility, security, usability, and maintainability
4. Clearly defined scope with explicit out-of-scope items
5. Technology-agnostic success criteria
6. Thorough edge case and error scenario analysis
7. Complete dependencies, assumptions, and constraints sections

**No Issues Found** - All checklist items pass validation

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to `/speckit.clarify` if any stakeholder questions arise
- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan

## Post-Implementation Analysis (2025-10-14)

After completing planning and task generation, a comprehensive cross-artifact consistency analysis was performed using `/speckit.analyze`:

### Analysis Results ✅

**Artifacts Analyzed:**
- spec.md (893 lines)
- plan.md (874 lines)
- tasks.md (1171 lines)
- constitution.md (384 lines)

**Findings:**
- Total Findings: 24 (2 Critical, 7 High, 10 Medium, 5 Low)
- Requirement Coverage: 89% (38 of 43 requirements have task coverage)
- Constitutional Compliance: All 6 principles verified

**Critical Issues (Fixed):**
1. ✅ C1: Added constitutional compliance verification to CHECKPOINT 3 (commit cd90853)
2. ✅ G1: Added NFR-1.3 disk I/O testing coverage to T021 (commit cd90853)

**Status:** ✅ **SPECIFICATIONS VALIDATED** - Ready for Phase 5 (US3) implementation

**High-Priority Recommendations (Non-Blocking):**
- Define "modern CPU" in NFR-1.1 (measurement methodology)
- Specify FR-2.5 top-N process range
- Clarify DISK/IO split timeline
- Move 24-hour uptime test earlier (T011 addition)
- Add file permission verification to T006
- Implement verbose mode in T005
- Document remaining ambiguities (measurement methodologies)

**Analysis Quality:**
- ✅ Well-structured and comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Strong requirement-to-task traceability
- ✅ Constitutional principles actively enforced
- ✅ Safe to proceed with implementation
